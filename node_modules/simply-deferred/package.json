  "readme": "#Simply Deferred\n###Simplified jQuery Deferred API for Node and the browser\n\n##Installation\n    npm install simply-deferred\n\n\n##Usage\n    var Deferred = require('simply-deferred').Deferred;    \n    var rendering = new Deferred();\n    rendering.done(function(){\n        console.log('Finished rendering');\n    });\n    \n    //...\n    \n    rendering.resolve();\n    \n##API\nSimply Deferred is partially compatible with jQuery's API, so the [docs and usage](http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/) are the same, except that they're restricted to the following methods:\n\n* `Deferred()`\n* `deferred.state()`\n* `deferred.done()`\n* `deferred.fail()`\n* `deferred.always()`\n* `deferred.promise()`\n* `deferred.resolve()`\n* `deferred.resolveWith()`\n* `deferred.rejectWith()`\n* `deferred.reject()`\n* `deferred.pipe()`\n* `deferred.then()`\n* `when()`\n\n###Usage with Zepto\nSimply Deffered also acts as a plugin to [Zepto](http://zeptojs.com/). The absence of a Deferred library was one of the biggest reasons I've been holding back, so I thought it made sense to write one. Once you have both Zepto and Simply Deferred on your page, just do `Deferred.installInto(Zepto)` to set it up. The installation makes the following changes to bring it closer to jQuery:\n\n* Aliases the `Deferred` constructor to `$.Deferred`.\n* Aliases the `when` method to `$.when`.\n* Wraps `$.ajax` to return a `promise`, which has only the following methods: `state()`, `done()`, `fail()` and `always()`. The arguments passed to the `done` and `fail` callbacks are the same ones passed to the `success` and `error` options.\n\n###Collaborating\nPlease feel free to raise issues on github.com/sudhirj/simply-deferred/issues - both obvious bugs or incompatibilities with jQuery are welcome.\n\nIf you'd like contribute a fix or a feature, that would be even better. Please make sure all pull requests are accompanied by tests, though. \n\nIf you'd like to start work on a feature that is not part of the jQuery library, let's talk about it first - the goal here for this library to be a drop in replacement for jQuery, with the same docs and API.\n\n",
